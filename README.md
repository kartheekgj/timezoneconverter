# TimezoneConverter Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension allows you to easily convert the current time into Central European Time (CET) and U.S. time zones.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <REPO URL>
```

Once cloned, navigate to the `src` folder inside the cloned repository.

### Load the Unpacked Extension

To load the extension in Chrome's developer mode:

1. Open the Extensions page by entering `chrome://extensions` into a new tab.
   - Alternatively, click the Extensions menu (the puzzle icon) and select "Manage Extensions" at the bottom of the menu, or go to the Chrome menu, hover over "More Tools," and select "Extensions."
2. Enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch at the top right.
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button.
4. Select the `src` folder from the cloned repository.
5. Once loaded, you should see the extension installed. If no custom icons are specified in the manifest, Chrome will use a generic icon.

You're all set! The extension is now ready to use for timezone conversions.
